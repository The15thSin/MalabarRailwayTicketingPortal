## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/The15thSin/MalabarRailwayTicketingPortal.git
$ cd MalabarRailwayTicketingPortal
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ pip install  virtualenv
```
then on Unix or MacOS:

```sh
$ python3 -m vitualenv env
```
and on Windows:
```sh
$ python -m venv env
```
Then install the dependencies as required for the project.
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
